00:00:05,080 --> 00:00:07,050
PROFESSOR: Co-teaching
with Srini,

2
00:00:07,050 --> 00:00:10,860
Professor Srinivas Devadas
is really a lot of fun.

3
00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:11,940
We've taught before.

4
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:16,170
We taught the 6006
that's on OCW together.

5
00:00:16,170 --> 00:00:23,480
And Srini is I would say one
of the most humorous professors

6
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:24,500
that I know at MIT.

7
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:27,040
So it's really a lot of
fun to teach with him.

8
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:29,910
And I mean, sometimes
it's like a comedy

9
00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:31,470
routine in his lectures.

10
00:00:31,470 --> 00:00:34,040
And I like to do that too in
lectures, tell lots of jokes

11
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:36,090
and play together.

12
00:00:36,090 --> 00:00:38,780
So it's really nice
working together.

13
00:00:38,780 --> 00:00:41,460
We have a good dynamic.

14
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:43,289
We're both super
flexible, like, oh, I

15
00:00:43,289 --> 00:00:44,580
need you to cover this lecture.

16
00:00:44,580 --> 00:00:46,109
Oh, no problem, I
love that stuff.

17
00:00:46,109 --> 00:00:48,150
In fact, we were both kind
of fighting over which

18
00:00:48,150 --> 00:00:49,290
lectures we wanted to teach.

19
00:00:49,290 --> 00:00:50,290
Because I was
like, I really want

20
00:00:50,290 --> 00:00:51,790
to teach this-- no,
no, I taught it.

21
00:00:51,790 --> 00:00:54,370
I really want to
teach it this time.

22
00:00:54,370 --> 00:00:55,840
So that's a nice
dynamic to have.

23
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:58,730
It's not like oh, you
taught one too few lectures,

24
00:00:58,730 --> 00:01:00,140
it's not balanced.

25
00:01:00,140 --> 00:01:02,450
Totally not like that.

26
00:01:02,450 --> 00:01:06,560
And both in 6006 and
6046, in the last lecture

27
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:09,260
we do a kind of
actual comedy routine

28
00:01:09,260 --> 00:01:12,570
where we're somehow
fighting each other.

29
00:01:12,570 --> 00:01:16,350
It's all in good humor,
and it's pretty fun.

30
00:01:16,350 --> 00:01:18,720
The students really like it.

31
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:23,350
He's also-- in both classes
he has creative ideas

32
00:01:23,350 --> 00:01:27,350
on how to reward students
for answering questions.

33
00:01:27,350 --> 00:01:31,010
So in 6006, we were in a
relatively uncomfortable

34
00:01:31,010 --> 00:01:31,930
lecture hall.

35
00:01:31,930 --> 00:01:35,917
And so we had these pillows
that we had custom printed

36
00:01:35,917 --> 00:01:38,000
and had the name of the
class and a little Rubik's

37
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,410
cube on it.

38
00:01:39,410 --> 00:01:41,665
And so if anyone ever
answered a question in class

39
00:01:41,665 --> 00:01:43,040
or asked a good
question, then we

40
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:45,970
would throw them a pillow,
kind of like a Frisbee.

41
00:01:45,970 --> 00:01:48,435
And so for 6046,
Srini was like, you

42
00:01:48,435 --> 00:01:52,030
know what we have to do this
time is get actual Frisbees.

43
00:01:52,030 --> 00:01:54,400
And so we got these blue
and purple Frisbees,

44
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:56,470
also custom printed
with the class number

45
00:01:56,470 --> 00:02:00,640
and a little diagram that is
in lecture 20 or something.

46
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:03,660
And so whenever anyone asked
or answered a question,

47
00:02:03,660 --> 00:02:05,650
we would throw them a Frisbee.

48
00:02:05,650 --> 00:02:07,700
We'd make jokes about
whether blue was better,

49
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:08,400
or purple was better.

50
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:09,240
There was no better.

51
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:10,840
It was just--

52
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:13,230
So this was tough for me,
because I had to really learn

53
00:02:13,230 --> 00:02:14,210
how to throw Frisbees.

54
00:02:14,210 --> 00:02:17,750
But I think by the end of the
semester, I got pretty good.
