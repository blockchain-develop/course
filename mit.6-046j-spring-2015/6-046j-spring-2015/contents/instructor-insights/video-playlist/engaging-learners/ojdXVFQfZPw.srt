ERIK DEMAINE: To me, the key
to teaching algorithms well

2
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:10,160
is just be excited
about the material.

3
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:13,890
I think if you personally think
these algorithms are really

4
00:00:13,890 --> 00:00:16,090
cool and like, wow, how
did they come up with this,

5
00:00:16,090 --> 00:00:18,870
and wow, I mean, look how this
thing interacts with this thing

6
00:00:18,870 --> 00:00:22,997
and magically it
all runs super fast,

7
00:00:22,997 --> 00:00:24,580
I think communicating
that excitement,

8
00:00:24,580 --> 00:00:27,260
students pick up on
it really quickly

9
00:00:27,260 --> 00:00:30,500
and themselves get engaged in
the material and care-- care

10
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:31,570
more about it.

11
00:00:31,570 --> 00:00:33,580
So I just try to have
fun with the material

12
00:00:33,580 --> 00:00:36,660
and encourage the students to
similarly have fun learning it.

13
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:40,770
So it all comes together.

14
00:00:40,770 --> 00:00:43,260
Occasionally, we'll
do a demonstration.

15
00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:46,180
But a lot of the
material in this class

16
00:00:46,180 --> 00:00:47,160
is pretty theoretical.

17
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:49,580
So it's mostly board
work and trying

18
00:00:49,580 --> 00:00:53,650
to draw representative
figures and things like that.
